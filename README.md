## Description:
Welcome to my project "Intangible", a website with a user interface that allows visitors to create personalized audio archives visualized through a 3D graph. This design is an unusual / experimental approach to UI/UX. The aim of this project is in a constant reemergence as the possiblities are so expansive, essentially, it is redefined by its user through their intention and interaction. 

## How it works:
Visitors are invited to provide an identifier. The purpose of this login process is simply for the scalability of the project. 
Once that is submitted, they can then record a sound snippet, rename it to their liking, and share it with the world. 
Once submitted, the audio goes into the 3D graph as a text node linked to other existing text nodes that were previously submitted. Users can then interact with the 3D graph by dragging nodes, orbiting the 3D viewer, and by clicking on a node to hear its sound. 

## Artist Statement:
As it stands, I would like to keep the goal simple: a different way to archive and listen to sounds. I currently find social medias seem to prioritize images over sound, and music platforms are restricted to a list of songs in an album. On music platforms artists are generally expected to share completed artworks or talks. I belive in the need for a space where mundane, and unrefined audio can be shared. 

The name Intangible relates to a quality of sound as a medium â€“ being intangible; abstract. Unlike images, sound is abstract in nature, thus it cannot be categorized in the same way. This way of mapping sounds visually and interacting with them provides a context for them to exist. Ideally, I would like to create personalized entry points into various databases of sounds. The login would serve as an access point to a specific bank of sound nodes. Whether it be a personal space for recording sound memos, or an archival space for a community at large.

## Process:
This project not only has a future ahead and coult benefit individuals and communities, it served me personally as a great opportunity to learn about the technologies used to build it. I entered this project with bare knowledge of JavaScript and no experience at all with back-end programming. 
Through research on internet culture, I found lots of ways I could link my sound-art background to a web project. Initially, I leaned more towards creating an informational website with a specific narrative through data. However, I personally found it not only difficult, but also boring to work with data. Sharing an opinion is easy, but any attempt to locate and display accurate data is challenging. I found the process to be a discrouaging rabbit hole of research and disappointment. For this reason, while keeping my initial rationale, I decided to create something playful, and an interface that would allow people to interact and contribute.
That idea was still scary and daunting as I knew I would have to delve into the complexity of setting up a server, but I trusted the process as well as the resources I had access to. 

## Acknowledgements:
I must acknowledge that this project would never have been possible without the help of contributors and the resources found along the way:
Thanks to Santo for introducing me to HTML, CSS and JavaScript and all your silly jokes along the way, you made this process really fun!
Notably, Sabine from the C-LAB (https://clab.concordia.ca/clab-workshops/) at Concordia who helped me revise my code in the early stages, setting up NodeJS, and understanding many important concepts, I truly appreciate all your valuable help.
Thanks to Gwen for the last minute debugging contributions between your mountain hikes!
Major thanks to Ox (aka oxgr) for all the time spent sharing ideas, discussing JS concepts, snacking & laughing, and the immense help with refactoring my code, thank you for truly teaching me the art of coding. 

**And thanks to YOU for reading!**

# art â‰  property 
Music, one of the fundamental carrier of culture, transcends words. It speaks the language of emotions, using pitch and rhythm to evoke feelings in a way that spoken language (with its reliance on meaning) does not compare. However, speech too carries emotional weight through its inflections, this goes to show the universality of music's foundation â€“ the expression of feeling. This fluidity allows to expand the definition of music to encompass any sound that carries emotional resonance, blurring the lines between musical speech and artistic expression.

Human beings are wired to imitate. As infants, we learn to speak by mirroring the sounds we hear, progressing from mimicking individual sounds to forming sentences. This process of imitation, integration, and then personal expression underpins all learning. For music follows the same formula. We are drawn to certain sounds and rhythms, we internalize them, and ultimately use them as building blocks for our own musical expression.

The intersection of art and commerce within the music sector often sparks debates surrounding intellectual property (IP) laws and their implications for creators. The advent of the internet has exacerbated this discussion, blurring the lines between legal and ethical considerations regarding copyright infringement and fair use. As a result, artists and content creators grapple with the balance between protecting their intellectual rights and promoting culture and collaboration.

The invention of the printing press arguably laid the groundwork for IP laws. Creators, particularly those of written works, lacked the means to prevent uncontrolled replication and subsequent undercutting of their work. However, in the context of music and other forms of creative expression, the application of IP laws becomes more nuanced due to the intangible nature of digital content. While capitalism incentivizes creators to monetize their intellectual assets, it also creates tensions between commercial interests and artistic freedom. Creativity thrives on the exchange of ideas. We copy, integrate, and reinterpret, building upon existing works to create something new. IP laws, however, aim to protect the very act of copying, hindering the very process that fosters artistic growth.
