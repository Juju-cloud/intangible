After switching to VITE, ox and I started to refactor the code.
We went step by step over each of the files. 
Currently, 
Main.js inits the following: 
- ui.js
- waveform.js
- socket.js
- audio.js

I now want to add forcegraph.js
It was working previously but i am confused now since i am working with ES6 and modules, things are different. I was previously importing three with an import map.
