*The way it works:*
Visitors are invited to provide an identifier. The purpose of this login process is simply for the scalability of the project. 
Once that is submitted, they can then record a sound snippet, rename it to their liking, and share it with the world. 
Once submitted, the audio goes into the 3D graph as a text node linked to other existing text nodes that were previously submitted. Users can then interact with the 3D graph by dragging nodes, orbiting the 3D viewer, and by clicking on a node to hear its sound. 

*Description:*
Welcome to my project "Intangible", a website with a user interface that allows visitors to create audio archives visualized through a 3D graph. This design is an unusual / experimental approach to UI/UX. The aim of this project is in a constant reemergence as the possiblities are so expansive. 

*Artist Statement:*
As it stands, I would like to keep the goal simple: a different way to archive and listen to sounds. I find currently, social medias prioritize images over sound and music platforms are restricted to a list of songs in an album, on these platforms it is generally expected to share long and complete audio files (music). I belive a space where mundane, and unrefined audio can be shared, is lacking. 

The name Intangible relates to a quality of sound as a medium â€“ being intangible; abstract. Unlike images, sound is abstract in nature, thus it cannot be categorized in the same way. This way of mapping sounds visually and interacting with them provides a context for them to exist. Ideally, I would like to create personalized entry points into various databases of sounds. The login would serve as an access point to a specific bank of sound nodes. Whether it be a personal space for recording sound memos, or an archival space for a community at large.

*Process:*
This project not only is useful and has a future ahead, it served me personally as a great opportunity to learn about the technologies used to build it. I entered this project with bare knowledge of JavaScript and no experience at all with back-end programming. 

*Acknowledgements:*
I should acknowledge this project would never have been possible without the help of contributors and the resources found along the way. 
Thanks to Santo for introducing me to HTML, CSS and JavaScript and all your silly jokes along the way, you made this process really fun!
Notably, Sabine from the C-LAB (https://clab.concordia.ca/clab-workshops/) at Concordia who helped me revise my code in the early stages, setting up NodeJS, and understanding many important concepts, I truly appreciate all your valuable help.
Thanks to Gwen for the last minute debugging contributions between your mountain hikes!
Major thanks to Ox (aka oxgr) for all the time spent sharing ideas, discussing JS concepts, snacking & laughing, and the immense help with refactoring my code, thank you for truly teaching me the art of coding.
